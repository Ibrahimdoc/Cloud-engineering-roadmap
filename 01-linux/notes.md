.Day -0 - Git setup complete.
Created roadmap structure and connected to Github.

Day 1 - Beginner 

- pwd shows current location.
- ls lists contents of current directory.
- cd changes working directory.


Why this matters: 
 Linux commands always act relative to the current directory.

Dat 1 - Medium 

- mkdir creates directories. 
- touch creates empty files.
- echo > file writes content to a file.
- cp cpies a file's contents to a destination.
- mv moves or renames files.
- rm deletes files permanently; rm -r deletes directories recursively.
- Linux commands fail silently if syntax is wrong.

Key notes: 
cp makes the destination file identical to the source; if the destination already exists,its contents are overwritten without warning.
Mistakes usually come from command structure or wrong assumptions, not the system itself.
