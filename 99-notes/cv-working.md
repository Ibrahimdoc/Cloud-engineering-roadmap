Working CV Log (WIP)

- Applied Linux filesystem and permission models to enforce least-privilege access, forming a foundation for cloud IAM.
- Investigated running processes using ps and top to identify CPU and memory pressure.
- Managed foreground and background processes; safely terminated processes using Unix signals.
- Demonstrated operational discipline by validating execution context (pwd) before destructive actions.
- Used Git to version-control infrastructure notes and operational decisions.
